# OpenTelemetry JavaScript Samples

These are the samples as used and demoed in my [Stahlstadt.js #24](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/stahlstadt-js/events/268136639/)
talk.

The demos show several stages (`01-server...` - `04-server...`) of "instrumenting" a simple
Node.js application with OpenTelemetry.
The folder `client-server` shows the step-wise approach of how to create an actualy
distributed trace for a client and a server application.

The version of [opentelemetry-js](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js) used in those samples is *v0.3*.
